# Ancient eDNA Journal Club

This journal club is an open offer to anyone who would like to read and discuss literature within the field of ancient environmental DNA/genomics. And can include papers with various scopes, but that all confines somehow within the field of Ancient eDNA. 

Since this is a new Journal Club it will be possible to help shape the format and how we do it. At the moment, Rikai, Guilia and myself, have volunteered to establish this new tradition. The CAEG centre will support the event with cake!!  

The first paper we will discuss is the Massilani paper and Rikai will give a short introduction to it. But it is important that you also read the paper so we can have a fruitful discussion! Please accept the coming calendar invitation if you are joining! 

A Programme could be as follows: 

1. One person presents for 10 minutes the main objective, methods, results and conclusions. 

2. Then we have a 30-minute discussion

3. Small chat about new papers for 5-10 min

4. 10 minutes on how we want to structure this journal club, what we need? who wants to help? 

5. Lastly, we decide on the next paper and who wants to present it.
